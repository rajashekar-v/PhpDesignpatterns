/**
 * The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. 
 * It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. 
 * This pattern is particularly useful when integrating new components into an existing system without modifying the original code.
